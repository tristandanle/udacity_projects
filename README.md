# Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Use Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. 
### Write code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics


## Meets Specifications
#### All code cells can be run without error.
#### Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis task
#### Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly..
#### Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks.
#### Functions are used to reduce repetitive code.
#### Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code.

### Script and questions:
#### Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered.
#### Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'.
